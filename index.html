            <h2>New Year, new me – fighting the dirty war of addiction.</h2>
            <p>
                During my time studying at Swansea University I was on the commitee for the
                'Help for homelessness' society. In my role here met and listened to the 
                stories of the homeless community in Swansea. Here is an article I wrote for 
                the news paper <Strong>Nation Cymru</Strong> which tells the story of Neil Parsons.

            <h2>Blue Before you.</h2>
            <p>Growing up, I always got excited when blue lights whizzed by.
                <br>‘Look at those heroes risking their life to fight crime.’
                <br>Like the movies, like the shows.
                <br>I was young, how could I know?
                <br>
                <br>I prepared myself for discipline
                <br>And God willing
                <br>I would be just like them
                <br>The Big Black Boots, The Helmet, The Shield, The Mace
                <br>The Stab Vest
                <br>
                <br>But wait,
                <br>I thought a shield is meant protect?
                <br>Not oppress
                <br>When someone is distressed
                <br>Is it really the best idea to send someone they fear?
                <br>A domestic solider in militarised gear.
                <br>What good is it to lock teenagers in a cage?
                <br>Fill them with rage then tell them to behave.
                <br>Keep them dumb, keep them ignorant
                <br>They’re all guilty until proven innocent.
                <br>
                <br>When you dissect this twisted system,
                <br>And see the effect on their victims
                <br>It’s hard not to lose faith
                <br>When they do not defuse hate
                <br>But create it, embrace it, entice it,
                <br>Then price it
                <br>and send you the bill.
                <br>Pay those taxes and submit your will.
                <br>
                <br>When the masses are calling for change
                <br>Who else can they blame?
                <br> Politicians make the order
                <br>But they carry out the slaughter.</p>

            <h2>Children of the Patriarchy.</h2>
            <p>
                <br>I keep your father at work and your mother in the kitchen
                <br>Watch me grind them down into nothing more than a man and a woman.
                <br>Listen,
                <br>
                <br>Boys will be boys; Girls will be girls.
                <br>But boys will employ, and girls will be cleaners
                <br>I train my sons to be killers and my daughters to be strippers.
                <br>I am the reason boys touch everything they see.
                <br>I am the reason girls can’t walk down moonlit streets.
                <br>And though I am at the heart of the problem,
                <br>it means nothing to me.
                <br>
                <br>They call me The Patriarchy.
                <br>
                <br>I have lasted throughout history,
                <br>And infected every part of society
                <br>Because I am cruel.
                <br>I said I am cruel.
                <br>Whether it is at home, at work, or in the school
                <br>you are all under my rule.
                <br>I make girls feel fat and make boys feel skinny
                <br>I am the only reason you can buy sex for money
                <br>I like my men angry, my women slutty,
                <br>And a nice pair of tits on page 3.
                <br>Every black eye covered in makeup is because of me
                <br>Can’t you see?
                <br>I am vile
                <br>I will defile your children:
                <br>
                <br>Keep those fists clenched, boy. Hold your shoulders high.
                <br>Never back down and don’t you ever cry.
                <br>Only cowards think of suicide.
                <br>You will learn how to punch before you can crawl.
                <br>You will learn to chase girls like they are a football.
                <br>
                <br>Shut your mouth, girl. You should learn to be quiet.
                <br>Look at those girls on Instagram, maybe you should diet?
                <br>That model looks fit in that dress, maybe you should buy it?
                <br>You will learn how to clean before you can read
                <br>You can try for a job, but you will never succeed.
                <br>
                <br>I Am Everywhere
                <br>Like A Virus

            <h2>Decay of an Oasis</h2>
            <p>
                <br>A flood of monotony and
                <br>whitewashed walls try to smother her
                <br>But her fire burns bright on this Turbo Island
                <br>Like a beacon
                <br>And the drums
                <br>The drums keep pounding
                <br>
                <br>Shields, batons, helmets for hire
                <br>Watch like hawks
                <br>As teddy-bear rioters paint her skin
                <br>And they dance
                <br>As the drums
                <br>The drums keep pounding
                <br>
                <br>Things are changing in the mild mild west
                <br>But her walls remain a mural of identity
                <br>And her song will always shake the streets
                <br>With relentless optimism
                <br>The drums
                <br>The drums keep pounding
                <br>
                <br>They pound by day; they pound by night.
                <br>They will not die without a fight
